## 📊 What I Did

### 1. **Loaded and Inspected the Dataset**
- Checked for null values
- Verified data types and summary statistics

### 2. **Visualized Key Features**
- **Histogram** and **KDE** plot for `Age` distribution
- **Boxplot** of `Age` vs `Survived`
- **Countplot** of `Sex` distribution
- **Barplot** showing survival rates by gender
- **Correlation heatmap** for numerical relationships

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Most passengers were aged between 20 and 40**
- **Females had a higher survival rate than males**
- **No major outliers** after proper cleaning
- Age had some skew but was handled via group-wise median imputation
- `Sex` showed strong correlation with `Survived`
